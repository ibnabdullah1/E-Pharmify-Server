- **Email Service:** Nodemailer
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt
- **Error Handling:** Custom middleware

## Features

1. User Registration with email verification

4. Dynamic Category Management
5. Shipping Address Management
6. Secure Authentication with password hashing and JWT
7. Role-based Access Control (Super admin, admin, user)
8. Error Handling and Validation
9. Integration with frontend for seamless data flow
10. Performance optimization and security best practices
